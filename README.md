A KDTree implementation in C#


## Summary
This is meant for educational purposes. Good for students or anyone wanting a simple project to learn C# with.

The code was written by copying the psuedo code implementation for a KDtree from wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree and converting it into C#. It is *not" meant to be performant or an example of best coding practices.
